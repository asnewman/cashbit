        h2 What is this?
        p Kozukai (“allowance” in Japanese) is a habit tracking method meant to boost productivity and encouraging better spending habits. The system entails coming up with habits, attaching dollar values to them, and tracking whenever you’ve completed a habit. When a habit is complete, its value is added to a running cash total. Whenever you spend money, you subtract cash from the same running total.
        p As an example, here are two common habits:
            ul
                li Exercise: $8
            ul
                li Read: $2
        p Throughout the week, let’s say you exercised 4 times and read 7 times. As a result, your banked cash is $46. This means you have earned $46 to spend on anything you like or need.
        p The values for these habits are up to you. Balance frequency and importance to come up with values. Don’t worry, you can adjust a value if a habit is too rewarding or not rewarding enough.
        h2 Why does Kozukai work?
        p Kozukai works because the system accomplishes the following:
         ul
            li It’s simple and requires little effort to track habits and spendings
            li It helps your prioritize habits
            li It’s rewarding to see the bank value go up
            li You can equate potential purchases to habits and calculate how many times you’d have to do them to come up with the cash
            li You feel that you’ve earned what you buy
            li If you want to make an expensive purchase, it encourages you to be on top of your habits and come up with new habits that are very rewarding (both in money and life improvement)
        h2 How do I start?
